# **Neo Terra: Website Project - Brunel University**
For my second-year project I worked as part of a group assignment that proposed to address climate change via a website application. 

The concept would help users become more aware of their impact on carbon footprint and become informed on ways to how to become more eco-friendly.

Using the SCRUM methodology, we designed and implemented the web application with HTML, CSS and Node.JS, offering different tools and resources to make information more accessible to everyone.
